# Customer_churn
we build a model to predict how likely a customer will churn by analyzing its characteristics:<br/> (1) demographic information, (2) account information, and (3) services information.
# Data set
The data set used in this article is available in the Kaggle (CC BY-NC-ND) and contains nineteen columns (independent variables) that indicate the characteristics of the clients of a fictional telecommunications corporation. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
