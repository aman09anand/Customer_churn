# Customer_churn
we build a model to predict how likely a customer will churn by analyzing its characteristics:<br/> (1) demographic information, (2) account information, and (3) services information.
# Data set
The data set used in this article is available in the Kaggle (CC BY-NC-ND) and contains nineteen columns (independent variables) that indicate the characteristics of the clients of a fictional telecommunications corporation. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn 
# Steps of the project
The project consists of the following sections:
<br/> 1.Data Reading
<br/> 2.Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning
<br/> 3.Data Visualization
<br/> 4.Feature Engineering
<br/> 5.Splitting the data into training and testing sets
<br/> 6.Assessing multiple machine learning algorithms
<br/> 7.Algorithm selected: Gradient Boosting
<br/> 8.Hyperparameter tuning
<br/> 9.Performance of the model
